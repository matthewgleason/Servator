# Servator
An app which allows people to contact the police in a discrete way.


Servator was created to help with stalkers contact the police without alerting the stalkers of their intentions to contact the police. On the outside, it is supposed to look
like a shopping app, so many of the user features are hidden in various parts of the home screen. The user provides their details such as their front and 
back profile, the stalker's front and back profile, their name and the stalker's name, and a description of their case that was recorded by police. Uploading your 
photos can be either from your photo libary or your camera. The photos are saved to disk as well as the other information. It utilizes the messaging API provided 
by Apple to connect the app to the user's messages. By clicking the phone button on the hme screen, you are presented a messages pop-up. There, all the information you
put in prior (names, photos, case description, etc) and your current location by address and current location by coordinates will be ready to send in your messages text box. 
If, and only if, you send the message, will you then be presented a recordings page. A recording will automatically be started after hitting send in the messages app.
The user can cancel and then start a new recording anytime they please. The recordings are saved to disk and can be viewed in another page of the app where they are all
stored for listening. The purpose of this is to show the police later that the stalker was near them at that time, and possibly use it as evidence for further conviction.
